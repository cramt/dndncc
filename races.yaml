      ### What are Lineages?
      Lineages are races that characters might gain through remarkable events. These overshadow their original race, if any, becoming their new race. A character might choose a lineage during character creation, their transformation having occurred before play begins. Or, events might unfold during adventures that lead your character to replace their race with this new lineage. Work with your DM to establish if you're amenable to such a development and how such stories unfold.
      ### Creating Your Character
      At 1st level, you choose whether your character is a member of the human race or one of the game's fantastical races. Alternatively, you can choose a lineage. If you choose a lineage, you might have once been a member of another race, but you aren't any longer. You now possess only your lineage's racial traits.
      When you create a character using a lineage option, follow these additional rules during character creation.
      ### Ability Score Increase
      When determining your ability scores, you increase one of those scores by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or you increase three scores by 1. You follow this rule regardless of the method you use to determine the scores, such as rolling or point buy. Whichever scores you decide to increase, none of the scores can be raised above 20.
      If you are replacing your race with a lineage, replace any Ability Score Increase you previously had with these.
      ### Languages
      Your character can speak, read, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character
      If you are replacing your race with a lineage, you retain any languages you had and gain no new languages.
      ### Creature Type
      Every creature in D&D, including every player character, has a special tag in the rules that identifies the type of creature they are. Most player characters are of the Humanoid type. A race option presented tells you what your character's creature type is. If an option does not provide a creature type, your character has the Humanoid creature type.
      Here's a list of the game's creature types in alphabetical order: Aberration, Beast, Celestial, Construct, Dragon, Elemental, Fey, Fiend, Giant, Humanoid, Monstrosity, Ooze, Plant, Undead. These types don't have rules themselves, but some rules in the game affect creatures of certain types in different ways. For example, the text of the [Cure Wounds](spells.cure%20wounds) spell specifies that the spell doesn't work in a creature of the Construct type.
races:
  - name: elf
    flavor_text: Elves are a magical people of otherworldly grace, living in places of ethereal beauty, in the midst of ancient forests or in silvery spires glittering with faerie light, where soft music drifts through the air and gentle fragrances waft on the breeze. Elves love nature and magic, art and artistry, music and poetry.
    category: common races
    Ability Score Increase: Your Dexterity score increases by 2.
    Age: Although elves reach physical maturity at the same age as humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claims adulthood around the age of 75, and can live to be 250 years old.
    Alignment: Elves love freedom, variety, and self-expression, so they lean strongly towards the gentler aspects of chaos. They value and protect others' freedom as well as their own, and are good more often than not. Drow are an exception; their exile into the Underdark has made them vicious and dangerous. Drow are more often evil than not.
    Size: Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and have slender builds. Your size is Medium.
    Speed: Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
    Darkvision: Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.
    Fey Ancestry: You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep.
    Trance: Elves do not sleep. Instead they meditate deeply, remaining semi-conscious, for 4 hours a day. The Common word for this meditation is "trance". While meditating, you dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive after years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit a human would from 8 hours of sleep.
    Languages: You can speak, read, and write Common and Elven.
    subraces:
      - name: dark elf
        Ability Score Increase: Your Charisma score increases by 1.
        Drow Magic: You know the [Dancing Lights](spells.dancing%20lights) cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast [Faerie Fire](spells.faerie%20fire) once, and it recharges after a long rest. When you reach 5th level, you can cast [Darkness](spells.darkness) once, and it recharges after a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells.
        Drow Weapon Training: You have proficiency with rapiers, shortswords, and hand crossbows.
        Keen Senses: You have proficiency in the Perception skill.
        Superior Darkvision: Your darkvision has a range of 120 feet, instead of 60.
        Sunlight Sensitivity: You have disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight when you, the target of the attack, or whatever you are trying to perceive is in direct sunlight.

    <p id="spell-body">You sense the presence of any trap within range that is within line of sight. A trap, for the purpose of this spell, includes anything that would inflict a sudden or unexpected effect you consider harmful or undesirable, which was specifically intended as such by its creator. Thus, the spell would sense an area affected by the alarm spell, a glyph of warding, or a mechanical pit trap, but it would not reveal a natural weakness in the floor, an unstable ceiling, or a hidden sinkhole.This spell merely reveals that a trap is present. You don&#x27;t learn the location of each trap, but you do learn the general nature of the danger posed by a trap you sense.</p>

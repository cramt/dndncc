You can change precipitation, temperature, and wind. It takes 1d4 Ã— 10 minutes for the new conditions to take effect. Once they do so, you can change the conditions again. When the spell ends, the weather gradually returns to normal.When you change the weather conditions, find a current condition on the following tables and change its stage by one, up or down.

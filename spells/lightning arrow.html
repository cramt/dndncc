    <p id="spell-body">The next time you make a ranged weapon attack during the spell&#x27;s duration, the weapon&#x27;s ammunition, or the weapon itself if it&#x27;s a thrown weapon, transforms into a bolt of lightning. Make the attack roll as normal. The target takes 4d8 lightning damage on a hit, or half as much damage on a miss, instead of the weapon&#x27;s normal damage.Whether you hit or miss, each creature within 10 feet of the target must make a Dexterity saving throw. Each of these creatures takes 2d8 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.The piece of ammunition or weapon then returns to its normal form.</p>
          <p class="spell-higher-levels"><span>At Higher Levels.</span>

    <p id="spell-body">Necromantic energy washes over a creature of your choice that you can see within range, draining moisture and vitality from it. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. The target takes 8d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.If you target a plant creature or a magical plant, it makes the saving throw with disadvantage, and the spell deals maximum damage to it.If you target a nonmagical plant that isn&#x27;t a creature, such as a tree or shrub, it doesn&#x27;t make a saving throw, it simply withers and dies.</p>

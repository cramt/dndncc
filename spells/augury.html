    <p id="spell-body">By casting gem-inlaid sticks, rolling dragon bones, laying out ornate cards, or employing some other divining tool, you receive an omen from an otherworldly entity about the results of a specific course of action that you plan to take within the next 30 minutes. The DM chooses from the following possible omens:Weal, for good resultsWoe, for bad resultsWeal and woe, for both good and bad resultsNothing, for results that aren&#x27;t especially good or badThe spell doesn&#x27;t take into account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or the loss or gain of a companion.If you cast the spell two or more times before completing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get a random reading. The DM makes this roll in secret.</p>

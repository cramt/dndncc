    <p id="spell-body">You brandish the weapon used in the spell&#x27;s casting and make a melee attack with it against one creature within 5 feet of you. On a hit, the target suffers the weapon attack&#x27;s normal effects, and you can cause green fire to leap from the target to a different creature of your choice that you can see within 5 feet of it. The second creature takes fire damage equal to your spellcasting ability modifier.This spell&#x27;s damage increases when you reach certain levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra 1d8 fire damage to the target on a hit, and the fire damage to the second creature increases to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier. Both damage rolls increase by 1d8 at 11th level (2d8 and 2d8) and 17th level (3d8 and 3d8).</p>

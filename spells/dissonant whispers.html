    <p id="spell-body">You whisper a discordant melody that only one creature of your choice within range can hear, wracking it with terrible pain. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 3d6 psychic damage and must immediately use its reaction, if available, to move as far as its speed allows away from you. The creature doesn&#x27;t move into obviously dangerous ground, such as a fire or a pit. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and doesn&#x27;t have to move away. A deafened creature automatically succeeds on the save.</p>
          <p class="spell-higher-levels"><span>At Higher Levels.</span>
        At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.</p>

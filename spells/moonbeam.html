    <p id="spell-body">A silvery beam of pale light shines down in a 5-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range. Until the spell ends, dim light fills the cylinder.When a creature enters the spell&#x27;s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it is engulfed in ghostly flames that cause searing pain, and it must make a Constitution saving throw. It takes 2d10 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.A shapechanger makes its saving throw with disadvantage. If it fails, it also instantly reverts to its original form and can&#x27;t assume a different form until it leaves the spell&#x27;s light.On each of your turns after you cast this spell, you can use an action to move the beam up to 60 feet in any direction.</p>
          <p class="spell-higher-levels"><span>At Higher Levels.</span>

    <p id="spell-body">Until the spell ends, ice rimes your body, and you gain the following benefits:You are immune to cold damage and have resistance to fire damage.You can move across difficult terrain created by ice or snow without spending extra movement.The ground in a 10-foot radius around you is icy and is difficult terrain for creatures other than you. The radius moves with you.You can use your action to create a 15-foot cone of freezing wind extending from your outstretched hand in a direction you choose. Each creature in the cone must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 4d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that fails its save against this effect has its speed halved until the start of your next turn.</p>

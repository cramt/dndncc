    <p id="spell-body">Your magic and an offering put you in contact with a god or a god&#x27;s servants. You ask a single question concerning a specific goal, event, or activity to occur within 7 days. The DM offers a truthful reply. The reply might be a short phrase, a cryptic rhyme, or an omen.The spell doesn&#x27;t take into account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or the loss or gain of a companion.If you cast the spell two or more times before finishing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get a random reading. The DM makes this roll in secret.</p>

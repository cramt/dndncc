Choose one of the following options for what appears:One beast of challenge rating 2 or lowerTwo beasts of challenge rating 1 or lowerFour beasts of challenge rating 1/2 or lowerEight beasts of challenge rating 1/4 or lowerEach beast is also considered fey, and it disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.The summoned creatures are friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the summoned creatures as a group, which has its own turns. They obey any verbal commands that you issue to them (no action required by you). If you don&#x27;t issue any commands to them, they defend themselves from hostile creatures, but otherwise take no actions.The DM has the creatures&#x27; statistics.</p>

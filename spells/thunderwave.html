On a failed save, a creature takes 2d8 thunder damage and is pushed 10 feet away from you. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn&#x27;t pushed.In addition, unsecured objects that are completely within the area of effect are automatically pushed 10 feet away from you by the spell&#x27;s effect, and the spell emits a thunderous boom audible out to 300 feet.</p>

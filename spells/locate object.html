    <p id="spell-body">Describe or name an object that is familiar to you. You sense the direction to the object&#x27;s location, as long as that object is within 1,000 feet of you. If the object is in motion, you know the direction of its movement.The spell can locate a specific object known to you, as long as you have seen it up closeâ€”within 30 feetâ€”at least once. Alternatively, the spell can locate the nearest object of a particular kind, such as a certain kind of apparel, jewelry, furniture, tool, or weapon.This spell can&#x27;t locate an object if any thickness of lead, even a thin sheet, blocks a direct path between you and the object.</p>

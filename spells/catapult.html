    <p id="spell-body">Choose one object weighing 1 to 5 pounds within range that isn&#x27;t being worn or carried. The object flies in a straight line up to 90 feet in a direction you choose before falling to the ground, stopping early if it impacts against a solid surface. If the object would strike a creature, that creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the object strikes the target and stops moving. When the object strikes something, the object and what it strikes each take 3d8 bludgeoning damage.</p>
          <p class="spell-higher-levels"><span>At Higher Levels.</span>
